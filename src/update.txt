- Mines selected state button seems to be styled incorrectly (Border is solid when it should be a gradient)

- Side history seems to be to far up vertically(Should be centered)

- The "additional" (history under the green and yellow boxes) side history font seems to be wrong.

- Game itself feels laggy and buggy

- remove loading animation on bombs spots
